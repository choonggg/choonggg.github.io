    <p class="content">
      Been writing production code since 2013, I started out doing simple Wordpress and OpenCart sites 
      and hoping I could do more. Since then, I've picked up Ruby on Rails never looked back.
      I can be found in my natural habitat, in the cafes. Usually reading and coding; or just browsing reddit.

      Having worked remotely for years in an agile environment, I'm able to bring messages and ideas across effectively
      while working in a distributed environment.
