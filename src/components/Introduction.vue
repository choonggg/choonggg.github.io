        Been writing production code since 2013, I started out doing simple Wordpress and OpenCart sites 
        and hoping I could do more. Since then, I've picked up Ruby on Rails never looked back.
        I can be found in my natural habitat, in the cafe. Usually reading about code, then coding, or just browsing reddit.
